                    Since being adopted by the Rocks and after getting his picture posted on the Internet, the two-year-old feline has become an international media celebrity.
                    
                    The Rocks have received calls from Good Morning America, Fox News and The Tyra Banks Show. The moggy’s mugshot has graced the pages of the London Guardian and British tabloids.
                    
                    Despite his strange appearance, Yoda – named after the pointy-eared Star Wars character (pictured below) – is a perfectly normal and affectionate cat and a delight to have around.</p>
